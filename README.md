# water_polo_project
One game that has yet to be released on the App Store and PlayStore is Water Polo. As a Kuala Lumpur State and 1st Team Otters Water Polo Club Player, I wanted to learn how to make a Water Polo Game. I chose to use HTML and JavaScript (JS) to build this game because it also allows me to simulate it in a browser, while modifying the physics of the objects.

my next goal is to used swift to build a mobile version of this game.
