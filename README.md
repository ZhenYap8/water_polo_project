# water_polo_project
One game that has yet to hit the App Store and become an iconic mobile gmae is Water Polo. As a Kuala Lumpur State and 1st Team Otters Water Polo Club Player, I wanted to learn how to make a Water Polo Game. I chose to use HTML and JV to build this game because it also allows me to simulate on a browser, while modifying the physics of the objects.
